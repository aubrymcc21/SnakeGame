Project Title: SnakeGame

Date: November 30, 2017

This is a simple mimic game of Snake in Java and Threads. Upon running the game, you immediately start playing as the snake, moving continuously in one direction looping around the screen until you input a key. The arrow keys move the head of the snake; connect the head with the "food" (the colored squares around the map). This will increase the length of the snake as well as relocate the food. If the snake's head collides with any part of the body, the game will end and the terminal will output your score.

This project integrated the use of Threads files into coding as well as testing my coding knowledge. I practiced OOP extensively with this project as well as a few data structures.

To run: java Main

Use the arrow keys to move.

This program requires a Java IDE of some kind to run. It has been tested both with BlueJ and Visual Studio Code.
